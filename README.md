# delivery-robot
WPI robotics class (rbe 1101) final project, where using design analysis, autonomous programming competency, sensor integration, and a custom built electronic circuit to navigate and deliver items in a model of WPI.

Here you will find the final program, the writen report, and some pictures of the project. 

Note: The final report was writen by multiple people. However, the program was written by me and integrated into a template that we were given. Essentially, the template handled the connecting to the remote control and handled the 20 sec autonomous time and 120 sec remote time.
